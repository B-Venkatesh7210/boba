## Adding L2 native NFTs to your wallet

On the [Gateway](https://gateway.boba.network) click on Wallet>NFT and paste the smart contract address of your NFT and as well as the TokenID. Once you have pasted the right address, the gateway wallet will find and show your NFT. If it's a Turing Monster, you can autoadd it by clicking `Fetch My Monsters`.
